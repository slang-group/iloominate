# Homer

Homer will be an app for templating, writing, and printing books for beginning
readers. It will support multiple languages, help writers use the letters and
words which children have learned, and support best practices and common layouts
for printing books.

## Contest

This project is developed as an entry to the Engaging Writers contest from
USAID / All Children Reading.

## Technical

The app must be available online and offline. The online portion of the
activity will be deployed on Heroku, using a Python or
Node.js server. The main storybook editor will be available through the site,
or offline as a Google Chrome app.
